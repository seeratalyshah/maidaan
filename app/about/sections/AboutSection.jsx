            Maidaan is Pakistan’s largest grassroots football initiative,
            dedicated to empowering street-connected and marginalized youth
            through the transformative power of sports. Founded by Muslim Hands,
            Maidaan is more than just a football program—it is a social movement
            providing opportunity, hope, and a pathway to a brighter future for
            thousands of children who would otherwise be left behind.

            We believe that every child deserves a chance—a chance to dream,
            play, learn, and thrive. Football is not just a game for these
            children; it is a tool for empowerment, building confidence,
            discipline, and resilience while opening doors to education,
            vocational training, and life-changing opportunities.
